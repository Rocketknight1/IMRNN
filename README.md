# IMRNN
Throwing RNNs at the IMDB database

##What is this?
A simple-ish Twitter bot and recurrent neural network (RNN) script that learns to generate new and plausible-sounding titles from the IMDB's list of English-language movies.

##Why?
I wanted to play with character-generation RNNs. Also sometimes it's extremely hilarious.

##Why do lots of the movie ideas feel like porn?
There's an awful lot of it in the IMDB database.

##What's your favourite movie title from it so far?
"Demons & Boyfriends". I think I might legit be able to sell that idea to someone.
